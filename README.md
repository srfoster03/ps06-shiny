# My Assignment Goals
For this assignment, I will be looking at a COVID-19 Dataset from Kaggle. It was published
a few years ago and the data was obtained from the year of 2020, when the outbreak started
to occur. There are numerous variables included in the dataset, including income, GDP, school
closure date, states, ICU Beds, hospitals, unemployment rate, and much more. I will be
focused solely on the population and financials aspect of this data, meaning I will
be comparing income and GDP to things like death and population in order to get a better
understanding of how death rates might have been different in areas due to financial reasons.
This is very important to understand because with less recourses and money, it is harder
for people to tay safe in a pandemic, and these numbers can tell me if this is true or not
and what needs to be changed for the future.

# Tab 1
In the first tab of my assignment I summarize what the app is about and why it is 
important. I also include a simple bar graph that shows each states death rates and gives an idea
of how the death rates were influenced by population size (seeing that many of the larger states have
very big numbers compared to others).

# Tab 2
In this tab there are three interactive options on the siderbar. The first one is to choose
the x axis as either GDP or Income, while the y axis stays constant at death rate on the scatterplot.
This can allow users to compare the difference in death rates to GDP and Income, however because population did
effect death rates, the second interactive option allows the user to select 1 out of 3 population
sizes for the same graph in order to compare GDP or Income to Deaths at the specific population
size. Finally, the last interactive piece, allows users to select from a drop down menu 
which state they want to see a conclusion about, that will include the state name, death rate, and population size.

# Tab 3
In the last tab I wanted to see how income and population went hand in hand, meaning see how
the size of the population during Covid effect how much income a person was making. On the 
side bar there is an option to choose from number of states they wish to see on the table.
The table is listed from least population to most population, so as you add more states, you add
higher population states. At the bottom of the paragraph that explains the page, the average of incomer to
population rates will appear based off of how many states you make available on the page.
